# Dungeon-Master-Game

The project is a Java program that allows users to explore a dungeon maze and engage in battles with monsters they encounter. It incorporates concepts like class relationships, abstraction, and interfaces to create a modular and extensible design.

Key Features:

Dungeon Maze: The program generates a random maze for the user to explore. The maze consists of interconnected rooms, some of which contain monsters.
Monster Battles: When the user encounters a monster, they can engage in a battle. The user's character can attack the monster, and the monster can attack back.
Healing: The program provides a healing mechanism that allows the user to restore their character's health points.
Start and Finish: The maze has a designated start room and a finish room. The goal is for the user to navigate from the start to the finish while battling monsters and avoiding traps.
Project Setup Steps:

1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have the latest JDK installed on your system. You can download it from the official Oracle website (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) and follow the installation instructions.
2. Set up a Java development environment: Choose an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans. Install the IDE of your choice and configure it for Java development.
3. Create a new Java project: In your IDE, create a new Java project with a suitable name for your dungeon maze game.
4. Define class relationships: Identify the key entities in your game, such as Player, Monster, and Room. Define appropriate classes for each entity, ensuring that you establish relationships between them using inheritance and composition.
5. Implement abstraction and interfaces: Utilize abstraction to define abstract classes or interfaces that capture common behavior and characteristics. For example, you could create an Entity interface or an abstract Character class that both Player and Monster implement/extend.
6. Design the maze generation: Plan and implement the logic for generating a random maze. You can use algorithms like depth-first search or randomized Prim's algorithm to create the maze structure.
7. Implement battle mechanics: Define the rules for combat and implement the logic for battles between the player and monsters. Consider factors such as attack power, defense, and health points.
8. Incorporate healing mechanism: Design a healing system that allows the player to restore health points when needed. This could involve items, spells, or rest areas within the maze.
9. Define start and finish rooms: Determine the layout of the maze and designate a specific room as the start point and another as the finish point. Ensure that the maze generation algorithm accounts for these requirements.
10. Test and debug: Thoroughly test your program to ensure that it functions as intended. Debug any issues or errors that arise during testing.
